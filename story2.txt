Three Little Pigs

A long time ago, there were three little pigs.
They planned building their house. 
Each pig built a different house.
One house was made of straw.
The other houses were different materials.
One day, a wolf came and did something.
So the house was destroyed.
And the pigs ran away.  

Pigs thought we need a more robust house.
So they built their house again with blocks.

And then wolf came again.
But he couldn't destroy the house.
