Three Little Pigs

A long time ago, there were three little pigs.
They planned building their house. 
Each pig built a different house.
The oldest pig is stupid so he made straw house.
The youngest pig is smart so he made stone house.
The other houses were different materials.
One day, a wolf came and did something.
So the house was destroyed.
But, the yongest pig house was not destroyed.
And the pigs except the yongest pig ran away.
