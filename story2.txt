Three Little Pigs

A long time ago, there were three little pigs.
They planned building their house because their mother would like them to be independent.
Each pig built a different house.
The eldest pig made his house using straw. Straw is very light and easy to find and collect. So, he thought straw was good to buuild a house.
The other houses were different materials.
One day, a wolf came to the eldest house. He blew breath strongly.
So the house was destroyed.
And the eldest pig ran away.
