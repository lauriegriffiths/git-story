Three Little Pigs

A long time ago, there were three little pigs.
They planned building their house because their mother would like them to be independent.
Each pig built a different house.
The youngest pig is smart so he made stone house.
The eldest pig made his house using straw. Straw is very light and easy to find and collect. So, he thought straw was good to buuild a house.
The other houses were different materials.
One day, a wolf came to the eldest house. He blew breath strongly.
So the house was destroyed.
But, the yongest pig house was not destroyed.

And the eldest pig ran away.

The other pigs thought we need a more robust house.
So they built their house again with blocks.

And then wolf came again.
But he couldn't destroy the house.
